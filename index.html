        Please answer the questions in the text boxes below in the format "0.00" using only numerical characters. Please remember that the total estimated carbon emissions output is only an estimate based on the average amount of carbon emitted from the activities and sources listed below. If you do not know the answer to any of the questions, please leave it at the default value to receive the most accurate calculation possible, but remember that the more information you put in, the more accurate the final value will be. Please also remember to be consistent with the input selection you chose for the time period (i.e., if you drove your car 3 hours every day this week and chose days, you would input 3, whereas if you chose weeks, you would input 21.
